This corpus contains a few articles from Wikinews for testing whether Durruti
works before undergoing a potentially hours or days long schema generation run.

Durruti in its current configuration expects parses from
Stanford CoreNLP version 3.4.1
*stanford-corenlp-full-2014-08-27*. I tried to just include that in this repo,
but the models were too big for Github to save:
http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2014-08-27.zip

You're welcome to try with newer versions, but I can make no promise of them
working correctly or consistently. This was the version I used when I first 
started my dissertation, and it took a month of non-stop processing to get the 
whole corpus (in eight parallel instances!) parsed, so that wasn't gonna 
change mid-dissertation.
